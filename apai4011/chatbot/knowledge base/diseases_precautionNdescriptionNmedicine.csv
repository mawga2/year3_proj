Drug Reaction,stop irritation,consult nearest hospital,stop taking drug,follow up,An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an injury caused by taking medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs.,"A drug reaction, often referred to as an adverse drug reaction (ADR), is an unwanted or harmful response that occurs following the administration of a medication. These reactions can vary in severity and can be classified into several categories. Allergic reactions happen when the immune system mistakenly identifies a drug as harmful, leading to symptoms such as rashes, itching, or even anaphylaxis. Side effects are predictable and often unavoidable effects that occur alongside the intended therapeutic effects of a drug, such as drowsiness from a pain relief medication. Toxic reactions may arise from excessive dosing or ineffective metabolism and elimination of the drug, resulting in toxicity. Idiosyncratic reactions are unexpected responses that occur in a small number of individuals, often influenced by genetic factors. Drug interactions occur when one medication affects the activity of another, leading to increased toxicity or reduced effectiveness. Common signs of drug reactions include skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing difficulties, and swelling of the face, lips, or tongue. If a drug reaction is suspected, it's crucial to contact a healthcare professional, as management may involve discontinuing the drug or providing supportive care. To minimize the risk, patients should inform healthcare providers about all medications and supplements they are taking, report any known allergies, and follow prescribed dosages carefully. Understanding drug reactions is essential for safe medication use and improving patient outcomes.","A drug overdose is when you take more of a drug than your body can handle — this can cause serious harm, or even be deadly. Overdoses can happen intentionally or accidentally, often due to unknown substances, drink spiking or reactions to drugs or prescription medicines. Drugs that people most commonly overdose on include opioids, amphetamines and MDMA. Overdoses are usually treated in hospitals with treatments such as intravenous (IV) fluids, antidotes, or activated charcoal to stop the body from absorbing the drug. To prevent an overdose, avoid illegal drugs, don’t mix drugs with alcohol, watch your drink and seek support.",

Falciparum malaria is the most deadly type.,"Malaria is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The malaria parasites belong to the Plasmodium genus, with five species that can infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium knowlesi, with P. falciparum being the most common and severe form. Symptoms typically appear 10 to 15 days after a mosquito bite and include fever, chills, sweating, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. If untreated, malaria can lead to severe complications such as anemia, respiratory distress, and even death. Diagnosis is made through blood tests that detect the presence of the parasite, and treatment usually involves antimalarial medications, with the choice depending on the type of malaria, its severity, and local drug resistance patterns. Preventive measures include using insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor spraying with insecticides, taking antimalarial medications when traveling to high-risk areas, and reducing mosquito breeding sites. Malaria remains a major public health challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where it significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality, especially among children and pregnant women. Ongoing efforts to control and eliminate malaria focus on vaccination, improved diagnostics, and increased access to treatment.","Malaria is a disease that is spread by infected mosquitoes. It's common in parts of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, the South Pacific and Eastern Europe. People in Australia who have travelled to affected areas may get malaria.

The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.","Arthritis is a term encompassing a range of inflammatory joint conditions that lead to pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced range of motion. The most common types include osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease caused by wear and tear on the cartilage, and rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the joints, resulting in chronic inflammation. Symptoms can vary but typically feature joint pain, tenderness, and stiffness, often worsening in the morning or after periods of inactivity. Diagnosis involves medical history, physical examination, imaging tests, and lab tests to determine the specific type of arthritis. Treatment options include pain-relief medications, physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgical procedures to repair or replace damaged joints. Regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and stress management are also crucial for symptom relief. While arthritis is a chronic condition, effective management can greatly enhance the quality of life for those affected.","Arthritis is the name for a group of conditions that affect the joints in your body.

Gastroenteritis,stop eating solid food for while,try taking small sips of water,rest,ease back into eating,"Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the digestive tract, particularly the stomach, and large and small intestines. Viral and bacterial gastroenteritis are intestinal infections associated with symptoms of diarrhea , abdominal cramps, nausea , and vomiting .","Gastroenteritis, often referred to as the stomach flu, is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines caused by viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections. Common viruses include norovirus and rotavirus, while bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella can also be culprits. Symptoms typically include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, and dehydration. The condition is highly contagious, spreading through contaminated food or water, close contact with infected individuals, or surfaces contaminated with pathogens. Diagnosis is usually based on medical history and symptoms, although stool tests may be conducted to identify specific pathogens. Treatment primarily focuses on hydration to prevent dehydration, with oral rehydration solutions recommended for mild cases. In more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be necessary. While gastroenteritis often resolves on its own within a few days, preventive measures, such as practicing good hygiene, proper food handling, and vaccination (for rotavirus), are key to reducing the risk of infection. Most individuals recover fully, but it is important to monitor for signs of severe dehydration, particularly in young children and the elderly.","Gastroenteritis ('gastro') is a common and very contagious illness that can affect your stomach and intestines, causing vomiting and diarrhoea. Babies under 6 months should always see a doctor if you think they may have gastro. Treatment of gastroenteritis includes drinking fluids to avoid dehydration â€” your doctor might not need to prescribe medicines. Reduce your risk of catching or spreading gastro by washing your hands well after using the bathroom, changing nappies and before handling food or eating. Children and adults should not return to school or work until 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea and/or vomiting.

Tuberculosis,cover mouth,consult doctor,medication,rest,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.","Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs but can also impact other parts of the body. TB spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing tiny droplets that contain the bacteria. Symptoms of active TB often include a persistent cough, chest pain, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and fatigue. Some individuals may have latent TB, where the bacteria remain inactive in the body without causing symptoms but can reactivate later. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of skin tests, blood tests, chest X-rays, and sputum tests to detect the bacteria. Treatment for TB usually requires a lengthy course of multiple antibiotics, typically lasting six to nine months, to effectively eliminate the infection and prevent the development of drug-resistant strains. Adherence to the treatment regimen is crucial for successful recovery. Preventive measures include vaccination with the Bacillus Calmette-Guï¿½rin (BCG) vaccine in certain populations, as well as improving living conditions and access to healthcare. While TB is a preventable and treatable disease, it remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in areas with high rates of infection and limited healthcare resources.","Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that can affect any part of your body, most commonly your lungs. TB can be latent (where you donâ€™t have any symptoms and are not infectious), or active (where you are unwell). The tuberculin skin test or a blood test can check if you have been infected with TB. TB can be treated with a combination of antibiotics that you will need to take for at least 6 months. The BCG vaccine prevents you becoming very unwell with TB, but it is only recommended in Australia for people at high risk of exposure to TB.","isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol"
